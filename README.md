A little game on Gosu
------------------
Hy guys, during LeWagon formation I had to do a small game with 
[Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/ruby.html) 
library. This is not a perfect app but have fun, clone it and improve it if you want.
Refactoring is necessary. 

# Installation
You need to install Gosu.
```bash
$ gem install gosu
```

## Structure
```
.
pong/
├── lib/
│   ├── ball.rb
│   ├── game.rb
│   ├── player.rb
│   ├── song.rb
│   └── ui.rb
└── media/
```

In `lib/` you will find :
`game.rb`which is the file to launch to start the game : in the terminal go in the in type in your terminal
